Hi, 

here is the code for anyone who was asked to count the number of weekdays (Mondays, Tuesdays, and so on) in a month of any year. 
Feel free to tweek it and / or maybe use it for your own tasks. 

'''
Initial idea stems from a request I got from my boss, and looking for ready solutions I found this function, 
that I slightly remodeled based on the correctness of output and the business task.
